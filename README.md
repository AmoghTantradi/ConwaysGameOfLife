Conway's Game of Life
======================================================
Conway's Game of life visualizer with additional functionality, allowing you to pause mid-generation and continue. It also allows you to generate the gif and reset the board.

The GIF functionality is based on code written by  [Kevin Kwok](http://antimatter15.com) for his jsgif project, which allows for an easier conversion of HTML canvas animations into gifs.
